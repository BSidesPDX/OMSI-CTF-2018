* 100 - bfbo - This challenge will give the player a binary with a vulnerable BO that they will need to use to jump into a function that normally wouldn't be called. This function will read a flag from disk and print it out to the user. This challenge requires the player to simply overflow a buffer, use the correct address of the uncalled func, and glory will be released!
* 200 - bfpl - This challenge will give the player the ability to run arbitrary shellcode to get the flag. Players will need to find /bin/sh, or any shellcode of their choice, to get the flag.

-- REVERSE ENGINEERING --

100 - sgnirts - Since this is an intro CTF, this challenge will force the player to use Linux commands to enumerate over a binary. The flag will be included in the binary as a string that can be found usings "strings", but with a twist requring some command line options!
